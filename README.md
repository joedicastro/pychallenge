# Python Challenge Solutions

## About Python Challenge

[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) is a website to solve
puzzles in which each level can be solved by a bit of Python programming.
It have 33 levels and its fun at the same time you learn how to use some
libraries in Python. The clues are very clever and requires patience and
tenacity to solve them.

## About this repository

There is my attempt to solve all the levels of this challenge, using the
python language. The target is to solve as many as I can.

## About Cheating

Don't cheat! If you cheat, you only fool yourself! If you can't do it, you
can not do it, that's all! Almost you tried, and if you keep trying and
trying, maybe one day you can solve these level that seemed so hard a
few early. And believe me, some ones are very hard to crack... some times the
puzzles are very subtle and evil!

Be proud of what you have achieved instead, even if is little. I'm very
proud to have solved all of this levels without cheating or copy another
else's solutions, I only followed some hints in the Python Challenge forums.
That's the right attitude.

But, once you have a solution, you can learn a lot from the solutions of
others. That's the purpose of the Python Challenge's wiki and it's fine.
That's the main purpose of this repository too. Maybe you couldn't learn a
lot from my solutions, maybe even you can laugh of the most naive ones, but
doesn't matter, be humble and remember that even the most idiot can teach
you always something. The second purpose is to have a online backup of this
code, some levels were very hard to break and I would hate to loose this code.

__The most important thing isn't the level that you reach, the most important
thing is what you have learned in the process and all the joy that you got!__
